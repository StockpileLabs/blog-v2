We are thrilled to announce the launch of Stockpile v2, our new and improved platform that transforms how funds are raised and allocated. Building on the success of our initial v1, we incorporated feedback and built a new program to create a more impactful and feature-rich experience.

## What’s New in Stockpile v2:

### Open-Grants System
Stockpile v2 introduces an open-grants system that democratizes the process of fund allocation. This feature allows anyone to submit proposals for grants, empowering a wider range of projects and ideas to find the support they need. The system is powered by a modified implementation of quadratic-funding, ensuring that the allocation of funds is equitable and community-driven. It emphasizes the importance of each individual contribution, regardless of the amount, making every donor’s voice heard in the decision-making process.

### Milestone Funding
We’ve implemented milestones for fundraisers, allowing potential contributors to understand what projects intend to accomplish.

## Benefits of Stockpile v2:

### Greater Inclusivity 
By allowing open submissions for grants, we are breaking down barriers and creating opportunities for a diverse range of projects and initiatives.

### Community-Driven Funding
The open-grants model places the power in the hands of the community, ensuring that funding decisions reflect the collective priorities and interests of the contributors.

### Enhanced Transparency
Stockpile v2 offers a high level of transparency in fund allocation, providing clear insights into how funds are being distributed and utilized.

The launch of Stockpile v2 marks a new era in fundraising and grant distribution on Solana. We are committed to continuously evolving and enhancing our product offering to meet the needs of a diverse user base, and foster transparency in grant processes. Ultimately, Stockpile is more than just a platform; it’s a movement towards a more democratic and fair approach to fundraising. We invite you to explore the new features and be a part of this exciting journey. Together, let’s redefine what it means to support and fund the projects that matter to us.
